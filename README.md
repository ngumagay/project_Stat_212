As technology evolved in the past ten years, so has the way the game of baseball has been interpeted. The technological advancement has allowed data analysts to do collect more and more data about baseball. So, with Peter being a pitcher and the rest of us being baseball players we decided to mold our question around the pitcher's side. At first, Hayes proposed the idea of trying to analyze the role weather and stadium dimensions played on a pitcher's success. But unfortunately there was not enough concrete data there for a project to be had. So, we decided to switch our question towards things that a pitcher could control. Then our research questions were molded: Do pitchers modify batters' behavior?, Do some pitchers elicit different swing speeds than others?, What causes changes in swing speed?. Each of these questions essentially getting more detailed into how a pitcher is able to control their pitches in order to have success against batters.

We determined that the best way to present our findings was through a Shiny App that would guide viewers through a narrative. The app features nine tabs, each offering a unique perspective on how we gathered statistical evidence to answer the three research questions we set out to explore regarding pitchers.
