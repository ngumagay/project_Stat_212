Over the past decade, advancements in technology have transformed the way baseball is analyzed. With these developments, data analysts have gained the ability to collect increasingly detailed data on the game. Given that Peter is a pitcher and the rest of us are baseball players, we decided to focus our research on the pitcher's role. Initially, Hayes proposed examining how weather conditions and stadium dimensions influenced a pitcher’s success. However, we found that there wasn’t enough reliable data to pursue that angle. As a result, we shifted our focus to aspects of the game that pitchers can control. This led to the formulation of our research questions: Do pitchers influence batters' behavior? Do certain pitchers generate different swing speeds? What factors cause changes in swing speed? Each question delves deeper into how a pitcher can manipulate their pitches to gain an advantage over batters.

We determined that the best way to present our findings was through a Shiny App that would guide viewers through a narrative. The app features nine tabs, each offering a unique perspective on how we gathered statistical evidence to answer the three research questions we set out to explore regarding pitchers.
